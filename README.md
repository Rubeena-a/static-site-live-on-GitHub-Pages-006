### Troubleshooting common problems & fixes

- Page shows 404 / Not Found: Ensure branch is main (or the branch you selected in Settings)
Ensure index.html is in repository root (not inside a folder)
Check Pages settings again; reselect branch and root folder then Save.



- Repository private: GitHub Pages for public repos works by default. If your repo is private and you have a free account, Pages for private repos may have restrictions — keep the repo public for the internship task.




- Branch named master instead of main : Either rename local branch to main (git branch -M main) or select master in Pages settings. Consistency helps.
